# DECISIONS.md — append-only log of judgment calls

## 2026-08-11 — Project scoping (Jerry + Claude)

- **1 character per player in v1; engine architected for N per side.** Fastest path to
  a playable duel; 2v2/3v3 becomes a data/UI change later.
- **Zero-cost hosting is a hard constraint.** GitHub Pages (client) + Cloudflare
  Workers free tier (rooms). PeerJS P2P is the documented fallback, not the primary.
- **No RNG in v1.** Full determinism simplifies netcode and makes duels feel fair.
- **Integer-only math for game values.** Percentage modifiers round down. Avoids
  float-ordering desyncs.
- **No Support archetype at launch** — healing an ally is meaningless in 1v1. Every
  kit gets some self-defense instead. Support returns with 2v2.
- **First to 3 kills / 12-turn limit / sudden death.** Scaled down from AR's 5/20 for
  a 2-character match.
- **Catalysts and ability mods deferred** (M6+). Balance layers, not core loop.
- **SVG rendering, no game framework.** Functional art; keeps agent effort on gameplay.
- **Cover simplification for v1:** cover occupies a full square, blocks movement, does
  not block LoS, grants directional 50% reduction to adjacent defenders. AR's
  edge-mounted half-walls are finer-grained; revisit only if playtests demand it.
- **Root does not cancel an already-locked dash in v1.** Simpler, and preserves the
  dash-as-escape read. Revisit if it plays badly (flagged in edge-cases.md).

## 2026-08-11 — Movement rulings (Builder, BACKLOG item 1)

Implementing board + movement surfaced four gaps the spec and `edge-cases.md` do not
cover, each resolved with the smallest call that keeps the engine deterministic.
**(1) Orthogonal-only, so corner-cutting is structural, not policed.** GAME_SPEC §3 says
"orthogonal steps; no diagonal corner cutting" — since a diagonal is never a legal step,
a unit walking around a wall corner simply pays for both orthogonal squares; there is no
separate corner rule and no diagonal movement anywhere in the engine.
**(2) Haste and Slow are summed as percentage deltas before a single round-down**
(`floor(base * (100 + haste − slow) / 100)`), so holding both nets back to the base
budget — the same shape as the Might/Weaken net-zero rule in BACKLOG item 5, rather than
applying two sequential round-downs whose result would depend on order.
**(3) Dead units block nothing.** `edge-cases.md` rules that walls, cover, enemies and
(in v1) allies block entry and pass-through; a unit at 0 HP is off the board until
respawn, so it neither occupies nor blocks its square. **(4) Self-intersecting move paths
are legal**, costing one budget point per square entered. Looping is never advantageous,
and forbidding it would be an extra rule to specify against contested-square and trap
resolution later. Root is enforced by zeroing the movement budget, so the same helper
answers both "is this path legal" and "what may the UI highlight".

## 2026-08-12 — Line-of-sight and concealment rulings (Builder, BACKLOG item 2)

Implementing vision surfaced five gaps the spec and `edge-cases.md` do not cover.
**(1) Line of sight is exact segment geometry, and corner grazes are permissive.**
Square centres are placed at odd coordinates in a doubled grid so the segment/square
test is pure integer arithmetic with no epsilon; a wall blocks only when the sightline
enters its *interior*, so a line passing exactly through a wall's corner still sees
through. The alternative (a touched corner blocks) is equally symmetric but makes
single wall squares cast surprisingly wide shadows. Flagged for playtest: two walls set
diagonally do not seal the seam between them. **(2) "Vision is mutual" (GAME_SPEC §3)
is a statement about range and line of sight, not about concealment.** Range and LoS
are symmetric by construction, so neither player ever has a longer sight radius;
concealment is deliberately one-way, since a unit that could not see out of brush while
hidden inside it would make brush useless. **(3) Brush patches use orthogonal
connectivity**, matching movement: brush squares touching only at a corner are separate
patches, so "we are in the same brush" never means brush a unit could not have walked
between. **(4) Adjacency for perception is Chebyshev — the eight surrounding squares —
even though movement adjacency is orthogonal.** Vision range is already Chebyshev, and
a unit standing diagonally against another is not plausibly unaware of them. **(5)
Adjacency does not break Stealth.** GAME_SPEC §6 ties the adjacency exception to brush
specifically, and Stealth is described as hiding a unit anywhere; only Reveal, attacking,
or taking damage should end it. This is the ruling most likely to want revisiting — if
Wisp proves oppressive, breaking Stealth at range 1 is the first lever to pull.
Consequently a dead unit is neither seen nor a seer (it is off the board until respawn,
the same rule that makes it block nothing during movement), and a player always sees
their own units regardless of terrain, which keeps the N-per-side architecture honest.

## 2026-08-12 — Two vision rulings added after self-review (Builder, BACKLOG item 2)

**(6) Units do not block line of sight.** `hasLineOfSight` takes only a board, so a
body can never occlude a sightline — the Atlas Reactor behaviour, and the one that
keeps free-aim honest: if standing behind the enemy granted cover, the mind-game would
become a positioning puzzle about hiding *behind* people. GAME_SPEC §3 lists only walls
as blockers and is silent on units, so this records the reading rather than inventing a
rule. **(7) Reveal masks Stealth; it does not end it — and that is a trap for BACKLOG
item 6.** GAME_SPEC §6 says Stealth is "broken by attacking or taking damage", while
`edge-cases.md` rules that attacking applies Reveal for one turn. Because `canSee`
checks Reveal before Stealth, an attack *looks* like it breaks Stealth: the unit is
visible that turn. But the Stealth status is still on the unit, so it re-hides the
moment Reveal expires. Whoever implements status application must clear Stealth
outright on attack and on damage rather than relying on the Reveal it grants. Flagged
here because the bug would surface a milestone later, in a file that looks correct.

## 2026-08-12 — Launch roster expanded to 9; Support pulled forward to v1 (Designer)

At the project owner's direction, the launch roster grows from 3 to 9 characters
(`docs/design/roster-v1.md`), organized as three archetypes — Firepower, Frontline,
Support — with a named theme per character and two archetype hybrids (Cinder:
Firepower/Support, Aegis: Frontline/Support). This **reverses the 2026-08-11 "No
Support archetype at launch" decision**: Supports are now designed to hold their own
in 1v1 by requiring every beneficial effect to be self-applicable (aimed circles
include the caster's square), with real-but-lower auto damage and one escape tool
each; their full value unlocks at 2v2 with no kit changes. Kit structure is fixed at
1 auto attack (cooldown 0, Blast) + 3 cooldown skills spanning ≥2 phases + 1
ultimate (100 energy), which fits the existing `4 abilities + 1 ultimate` schema
untouched. Wisp is reclassified `trickster` → `firepower` (theme "Phantom" / Stealth
Firepower) so archetype is a balance class and theme carries the flavor;
`'trickster'` stays in the `Archetype` type as a deprecated label — no engine change.
The roster introduces two `ENGINE ASK`s recorded in roster-v1.md §9 (effect target
affinity in mixed areas; energy gain on ally-benefit) that the Builder must not
improvise around.
